## Create A Faction

We are still working on creating an application that automatically creates your faction, until then you can create a ticket on discord.

- You can only own one faction.
- Changing the name of a faction (including the TAG) or to transfer ownership will cost `500⎈`

Information you need to provide to create a faction:
1. Type of faction:
    - Small - `max roles: 5, max users: 10, cost to create: 200⎈`
    - Medium - `max roles: 10, max users: 25, cost to create: 400⎈`
    - Large - `max roles: 15, max users: 50, cost to create: 1000⎈`
    - Enterprise - `max roles: 15, max users: 100, cost to create: 2500⎈`
2. Name of your faction.
3. Faction description.
4. Faction abbreviation, has to be at least 2 or more characters (example: Government is GOV).
5. Roles names `You cannot have roles named: admin, staff, coastguard`.
6. Provide discord (this is not requried) You dont have to have a discord to create a faction.

:::caution Have A Discord Server?

- Owners that have a Discord server for the faction they are running are required to have at least one admin from the main server in the server with the administrator permission.
- The owner of the faction must be the owner of the Discord server.
- Servers must have 2FA enabled `(Server Settings -> Safety Setup -> Permissions -> Enable 2FA)`.

:::

## Faction Deletion

To initiate a faction deletion request, you must meet the following criteria:
1. Be the designated owner of the faction.
2. Possess ownership of the Discord server associated with the faction.

If the above requirements are meet then you can submit a ticket on discord and request to have your faction removed. After you have confirmed you wish to delete the faction the following will be permanently deleted.
- Faction Name, Faction Abbrv, Faction Roles, Faction Members, Faction Settings (Bio, Avatar, Banners).
- Any remaining credits left in the faction at the time of deletion will be transferred to the Treasury.

Prior to commencing the deletion process, individuals overseeing a Faction Discord server must ensure its removal.

A faction that remains undeleted retains its active status, with the faction owner retaining responsibility for both the faction's upkeep and adherence to existing and future faction rules and requirements, until its deletion, irrespective of any other considerations.

## Example

Below we have an example of what the outcome would look like if you customize everything.
