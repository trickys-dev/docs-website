## Multiplayer Mod

</span>
We use the Luna Multiplayer Mod for our KSP server. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/LunaMultiplayer/LunaMultiplayer/releases). Make sure to download the "lastest" version and not a "pre-release".
<span class="game-ksp">

### Installing Mod

</span>
- Once you are on the releases page, you are looking for "LunaMultiplayer-Client-Release.zip" to download.
- Inside the Client zip you will see a folder called `GameData`. You must put the `GameData` folder into your main KSP folder ("merge"/"replace" the two `GameData` folders).
- Once you have done that just start KSP.
