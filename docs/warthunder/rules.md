</div>

1. No spawn camping, especially on maps on relatively flat/hilly terrain; spawn protection zones are indicated as black circles on the map <span class="text-muted">(3 strike rule: if enemy teams use all three strikes, then they forfeit the round)</span>

2. No teamkilling. Due to the nature of the game, friendly fire accidents are not common but they do happen in instances of allies going into artillery or getting bombed by accident <span class="text-muted">(one-off incidents are to be looked over, but consistent team skills that ruin the experience will result in punishment dealt by the game manager).</span>

3. The use of "Vaulted Vehicles" is forbidden <span class="text-muted">(vehicles that are removed from tech trees for balancing reasons or are event exclusive; a brief exemption can be made if the vehicle has been made available for a short period of time at around the time of an upcoming event, this short period can be 1-1 ½ months when the vehicle was made available).</span>

Example list of “Vaulted Vehicles” within the current 6.7 BR maximum range;

4. On certain game modes and maps, teams are to not progress past the capture point; the only exception is within or next to the capture point itself, <span class="text-muted">(every map has different capture point sizes, the examples shown below is to provide a general idea of what is accepted and is NOT EXACT)</span> this is to provide a fair chance for teams and to reduce the likelihood of a choke point on the capture point this is to give the teams a fair chance to regain a footing on the battlefield and to give them a chance to leave spawn.
