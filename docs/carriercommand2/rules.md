## Joining A Team

1. You must [sign up to a team](https://trickys.gg/events) on the website to take part prior to event start
You will not be able to sign up after event start time.
2. If you sign up for a team and fail to show without good reason you may be banned from future events. This does not apply to the Reserve Group. 
3. If all slots on all teams are full, there is a “Reserve” Group. Signing up to this team does not guarantee a spot in the event.
4. Reserve players may ask to join understrength teams during the event. A team is considered understrength when they have less than 6 players for single carrier games and 12 players for multi carrier games.
5. The server used is the Tricky’s EU#1 Server. The password for this server will be given in the <span class="discord-text">#⭐︱cc2-event</span> channel at event start that is only visible to those who have joined a Team, this channel is not visible to the Reserve Group. Revservists must ask for the password from the team they wish to join.
