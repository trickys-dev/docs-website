These rules apply to our FS22 Server.

## Section 1
### General

<a class="tricky-color">1.0</a> Respect must always be shown to other players, their equipment, crops, livestock, and property.<br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.0.1</a> Flipping, ramming, or any other type of vehicle abuse is never acceptable. If the player is a farm manager, the cost of the repair to the damaged property will be taken from your bank. If you are a contract worker, you will be given a 1-hour suspension.

<a class="tricky-color">1.2</a> When purchasing property around the map, please buy it near your initial property. If you want to buy unowned land next to another farm, please contact that farm manager and make sure they do not intend to use it. Some exceptions may apply depending on the situation.<br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.2.1</a> Two farms have purchased all other land and there is 1 property left between the two of you, at this point the land is first come first served.<br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.2.2</a> If you have purchased all the land in your vicinity and are out of property to expand into then you may start in another area of the map. When there is no other farm in the vicinity of land you are looking to buy, we ask that you consider the future of the map if fresh players join will there still be areas of the map open for them to start their farm.

<a class="tricky-color">1.3</a> When you go about your day-to-day activities on the server, please remember to remove any vehicles, pallets, bags, or any other sort of materials that you leave around the map (off your property) before you log off from that session.
You are allowed to leave a one (1) vehicle on the shop property, but we ask that you keep this in the corner out of the way, and that its size be kept on the smaller size out of respect for the other players.<br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.3.1</a> If you find you are not able to use all the resources in a pallet/bag/container, please move it either to your farm or to the designated area of the lot so they are out of the way.<br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.3.2</a> After the 24 hours have elapsed the Game Manager will step in and sell the vehicle back to the shop to keep the area clear for other players to use. (If you for whatever reason need to leave a vehicle there and are unable to move it yourself, please leave a message in discord and someone will move it for you, and it will not be sold.)<br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.3.3</a> If a player blocks the shop from spawning new vehicles when another player performs a purchase, they will be fined $10,000 for each vehicle, or trailer, $1,000 for each pallet, bag, or vehicle accessory (these are things like forklift attachments, bale forks etc.). There is no reason this should ever happen. If you are in the middle of making a big purchase from the shop (such as the initial setup of a new farm) make sure that you are moving the new vehicles out of the way before you buy more.

<a class="tricky-color">1.4</a> Do not create landscapes which will hinder the map use for any future tenants of the farm you currently are using. There is no reason that the land should ever be in a state where it is unusable. If we suspect that this is the case, we will contact you.<br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.4.1</a> The land should not have any mountains that were not part of the original map.<br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.4.2</a> There shouldn’t be any kind of hinderance put on the map like small bumps that get vehicles stuck on them.<br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.4.3</a> While we have a mod that allows for trees to be cut down anywhere, we ask that you only cut down trees that are on your property. <br/>
<a class="tricky-color">1.4.4</a> If you are asked or hired by another farm manager to do so on their property, then by all means you may. If you feel a tree is in a poor position for whatever reason please reach out to the Game Manager if it is on common property, or the farm manager if it is on owned property.

## Section 2
### Rules Of The Road

<a class="tricky-color">2.0</a> Road lines will not be considered an imposed regulation. The exception to this is when you need to pass someone either travelling in the same direction or oncoming traffic. When this is the case, the direction of travel will be drive on the right side, pass on the left when safe.

<a class="tricky-color">2.1</a> When moving a large load, semi-trailer, or if you are about to take up the road to perform a maneuver that will block the road in both directions you are expected to turn on your hazard lights and warning lights (amber lights) to inform any other drivers to give you space, so they don’t crash into you. If someone is behind you, it is best to let them pass before you continue so as to not impede them.
