# AutoAuth
AutoAuth (Automatic Authorization)

## What is AutoAuth?

The "AutoAuth", or Automatic Authorization system authorizes you on all our servers automatically without any admins or staff needing to be on the server at the same time as you.


## How Does AutoAuth Work?

Once you join the website you will be authorized on all of our stormworks servers automatically.

When you join the server, the system will check the following things from our website:

- Checks if you are perm-banned or temp banned from the server you are joining.
- Checks if you have an account on the website. (Steam & Discord linked)
- Checks if you are authorized on the server you joined, if not then you will be AutoAuthed.
- Checks if you are authorized and have a valid boat license. This is only needed if you have a boat license.

## I have Auth But can't Spawn Boats?

You need a boat license for the AutoAuth System to authorize you to spawn boats.

Already have a license? Check if its valid.

## Do I Have Auth?

One way of checking if you have auth is just to join one of our Stormworks servers and you will get one of the following pop-ups.

<!-- css for flex -->
  <div class="flex-vcenter">
    <div class="img-mg">
      <img src="/img/autoauth/tsauth1.png" width="300px"/>
    </div>
<p>

This message will show if you are successfully authorized in-game when joining.

  </div>
