## Cargo

1. First you must choose to do land/sea cargo or air. (For this guide we will choose land/sea)

:::note A couple of notes

- Locations you can deliver are different between land/sea or air. For example, Oâ€™Neil (Air) can deliver to the Arctic, but North Harbor (Land/Sea) can not.
- You can NOT take any land/sea cargo into the air, this is against HRP Laws and will result in a fine on the spot. (Unless you are loading it within 1km of terminal)
- You are NOT allowed to take air cargo by land/sea, this is against [HRP Laws (2.2)](/hrplaws#23-airiso-container-mismanagement) and will result in a fine on the spot.
- You are only allowed 2 of any type of cargo by [HRP Laws (2.4)](/hrplaws#24-player-container-limit).

2. Figure out where you want to go using the `?listdst command` (deliver locations dependent on your location)
3. Use the `?claimto [Number]` command to claim cargo to that destination. <img src="/img/hrp/cargooil/HRPClaimTo.png" />

4. Go to the delivery location, for this guide we are going to Spycakes.
5. Once you get there look at the cargo for the id then run `?deliver [cargo id]`. <img src="/img/hrp/cargooil/HRPDeliver.png" width="750px" />


## Oil

1. You must be in a [faction](https://trickys.gg/factions), you can either join one or [create](factions.md#create-a-faction) a new one.
2. Find an oil point on the map. (This will give 30cr once captured)

3. Go to oil point and wait for capture.

4. Once captured you will get money, the point will be uncaptured, and will be on cooldown for 30mins so wait or find another point.
