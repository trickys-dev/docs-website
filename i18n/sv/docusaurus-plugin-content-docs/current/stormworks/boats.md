# Båtar

1. För att använda båtar & amphibiefordon på vattnet på servrarna 1, 2 & 3 du kommer behöva en båtlicens.
2. Minimum of 24 hours must have passed if you want to apply for a boat license from when you joined the website.
3. Your boat must not exceed `40 meters` in length -> `160 Blocks`, to reduce lag.
4. You need a boat license to use an amphibious vehicle on water.
5. You cannot use workshop vehicles which you didn’t make.
6. Float-planes and float helicopters can take off and land on water, but not move anywhere except to take off again unless they have a boat license.
7. Nav lights are required for boats, seaplanes when on water, and amphibious vehicles when on water, unless you are docked(for example to dock or land)(view screenshots below for further details on light placements)
8. Submersibles need nav lights when moving above water.
9. You cannot use spotlights or indicators as nav lights.
10. You must stop for staff if requested!


:::tip

You only need to have nav lights on during the night and/or low visibility.

:::caution

You cannot use flashing blue or red lights as these are used by staff.

## Applying For a Boat License

1. Make sure your boat meets the requirments.
2. Head over to [applications](https://trickys.gg/applications/new) and select Boat License.
3. You cannot apply for your 1st ever license with a sea-plane, you need to apply with a boat. Once you have a [Boat ID](boats.md#boat-license-placement) you can place that onto your sea-plane.

:::tip Tip

When you provide a screenshot of the boat in the application, showing the length of the boat within the screenshot speeds up the process.
