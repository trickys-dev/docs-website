# Serveur de train

Ce serveur est destiné aux opérations ferroviaires de jeux de rôles. The section of railway from Spycakes to Camodo recreates absolute block signalling for roleplay between signalling and train drivers in a realistic railway setting.

:::note Absolute Block Signalling Summary

Le chemin de fer est divisé en quatre sections contrôlées par quatre boîtes de signal distinctes. Ce système assure une exploitation sûre des trains sur le chemin de fer en ne permettant qu'un seul train dans une section à la fois.

:::caution Banned Components

- Jet trains
- Nuclear reactors

### Limites de Vitesse

The railway is divided up into sections with different speed limits. These limits are indicated by signs across the railway in miles per hour (mph).

Please see the following general speed limits on the railway:
- Yards = 10mph
- Bend between Spycakes and North Donkk = 80mph
- Rest of the line = 100mph

:::caution Overspeeding

If you are caught going over 100mph you will be kicked, if you continue to break this rule you may be banned from the train server.

### Signals
This system uses traditional upper quadrant semaphore signals, which means that insted of traffic light signals that you may be used to, these signals use moving arms with corresponding lights that inform the driver if they can continue or stop.

All signals on this railway are upper quadrant semaphore signals, this means that a horizontal arm always means the signal is on displaying a danger or caution aspect. An arm that is pointing upwards indicates the signal is off, which means it's clear to proceed.

<b>Home/Starter Signal</b>

<div class="flex-vcenter mb-1">
    <img src="/img/trainsrv/trainsrvredsignal.png" width="300px"/>
    Signal on = Danger<br/>
    You should stop if you see this signal
  </div>
  <div class="flex-vcenter mb-1">
    <img src="/img/trainsrv/trainsrvgreensignal.png" width="300px"/>
    Signal off = Clear<br/>
    If you see this signal you are clear to continue to the next signal
  </div>
<b>Distant Signal</b><br/> You will encounter these distant signals before home/starter signals to give you warning whether they are at danger or clear. You can think of these as yellow traffic lights on the road.
  <div class="flex-vcenter mb-1">
    <img src="/img/trainsrv/trainsrvyellowsignal1.png" width="300px"/>
    Signal On = Caution<br/>
    You should prepare to stop as one of the following Home/Starter signals may be at danger
  </div>
  <div class="flex-vcenter mb-1">
    <img src="/img/trainsrv/trainsrvyellowsignal2.png" width="300px"/>
    Signal Off = Clear<br/>
    You are clear to continue
  </div>
<b>Fixed Distant Signal</b>
  <div class="flex-vcenter mb-1">
    <img src="/img/trainsrv/trainsrvyellowsignal3.png" width="300px"/>
    When approaching Camodo from the Sawyer Islands you will first come across a fixed distant signal. As the name describes, this signal is fixed on constantly at caution indicating you must be prepared to stop at the next home/starter signal displaying a danger aspect
  </div>

### Communication

    Should you need help you can contact signallers in chat or by radio. Each signal box is set up with its own radio telephone and you can find the frequency of your nearest signal box using map labels.
