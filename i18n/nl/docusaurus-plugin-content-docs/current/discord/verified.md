## Check If I'm Verified

There are a few ways to check to see if you are Verified.

- Via Website, go to My Account and check if you have discord connected. If you have Discord connected then you will be verified.
- Via Discord 1, go to <span class="discord-text">ðŸ¤–ï¸±bot-commands</span> and use the `/account` command. If the bot replies with account account info then you are verified.
- Via Discord 2, look at your roles if you have the Verified role then you are verified.

## Manual Approval

When registering for the very first time your account may be selected for manual approval, for most accounts this process is automatic and don't need manual approval.

There are many reasons why our system could select an account for manual approval, there is nothing to worry about if you get selected its just another step that you have to go though which many other users have done without any issues.

:::caution Waiting For Approval

If you have been selected for manual approval make sure to create a ticket on our discord server stating that you need manual approval and a admin will deal with it, your account wont be approved until you have done this.
